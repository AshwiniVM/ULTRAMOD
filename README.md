# ULTRAMOD
Using comparative genomics to uncover the origins of phenotypic modularity in squamate reptiles

FIRST STEPS - a code file based in unix. Written to obtain chromosome assemblies and map Ultra Conserved Elements (UCEs) on them. The resultant files provide a list of .sam files with 
a list of UCEs mapped onto each chromosome with details on the mapped position and UCE sequence. A csv file porivdes details on the number of UCEs mapped onto each chromosome.

MappedUCEs_Chromosome_clusters - R code steps to obtain clusters of chromosomes from different species that are most similiar based on their UCE compositions. ALl other files are files named in this piece of code and can be used to run this code
